## Introduction

This is a modified version of official UOX3.

UOX3 stands for Ultima Offline eXperiment 3.

It is a server emulator for OSI's Ultima Online Server, and the very first version was created by the mysterious figure known as Jaegermeister way back in 1996 or 97. Marcus Rating(Cironian) took over development of UOX, and then created UOX2, followed by UOX3 (current version). This server emulator enables you to create your own UO server and play on it either locally, over modem, LAN or the internet with at least(but not by any means limited to..) 32 people at a time, depending on your server hardware/connection speed.

There is no fee to set up an UOX3 server, and there should be no fees associated with playing on one(paying for your own general access to the Internet excluded). UOX3 is more or less always in an "Alpha"-stage, since there's no clear set goals for what a "finished" UOX3 should consist of. Nor is it likely that UOX3 will ever reach such a "finished state", since new people arrive with new ideas and thoughts, thus the emulator keeps evolving/changing.

Even though Marcus Rating created UOX2 & 3, he released the sourcecode for the server emulator and slowly backed down from active development. Over the years many other programmers have worked together to further enchance and improve the emulator. To see a small list of some of the people who have contributed to UOX3, check out the UOX3 Hall of Fame located in the History-section of UOX3.org.

Another thing that came with the release of the UOX3 source-code, was that no one can run a public UO server with modifed UOX3 code, without releasing that modified code to whoever requests to see it, which will hopefully help make UOX3 a public/common effort instead of having a few "elitist"-shards, each with their own carefully treasured secrets.
